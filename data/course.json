  "course_description": "The mammalian immune system is sometimes called a \u201cliquid organ,\u201d capable of rapidly initiating and then resolving potent responses to pathogens at almost any location in the organism. What protein machinery drives immune cells\u2019 rapid migration? How do cells make pathfinding decisions around barriers? How do they find rare pathogens or target cells in complex environments?\n\nThis course will begin by examining the general immunological functions of two major immune cell types\u2014T cells and dendritic cells. Through our readings and discussions, we will examine the connections between immunotherapy as an emerging treatment modality for a variety of cancers and the migration of immune cells.\n\nThis course is one of many [Advanced Undergraduate Seminars](https://biology.mit.edu/undergraduate/current-students/subject-offerings/advanced-undergraduate-seminars/) offered by the Biology Department at MIT. These seminars are tailored for students with an interest in using primary research literature to discuss and learn about current biological research in a highly interactive setting. Many instructors of the Advanced Undergraduate Seminars are postdoctoral scientists with a strong interest in teaching.\n",
