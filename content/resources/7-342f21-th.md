  caption: In this image, specialized immune cells called dendritic cells (in green)
    are sticking to and interacting with a bunch of tumor cells (red/purple), all
    of them embedded in a gel so they can move around and grow in 3D. (Image courtesy

  image-alt: Tumor cells, stained in purple, are growing in a diamond-shaped lattice
    pattern. In between and around these cells are small bright green blobs, which
    are the dendritic cells.
